# CPN-Studio Requirements Engineering

1. ability to use the CPN Tools SML simulator
2. need concept of CPN modules (submodels) stored in seperate files (unlike the monoholitic CPN Tools model file)
3. local scope of declarations - not a single global scope as with the current declarations
4. ability for a substitution transition to refer to a submodel stored in a different file - build path?
5. versioning and diff both at the abstract syntax and concrete syntex level
6. undo/redo
7. ability to go forwards and backwards in an interactive simulation - explore a tree-like structure
8. notion of a project explorer containing the submodels and declarations included in the current project 
9. language-aware code editing capabilies for SML declarations, colour sets, and functions
10. more to come here
